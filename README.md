This is a React app destined for public deployment at the GitHub Page brriann.github.io.

Initial purpose will be to provide a portfolio of work and current projects.
In this repository, I hope to create a simple React template with basic features that I can easily reuse.

Dev notes:
1. source branch holds development code
2. master branch contains production-optimized static files
3. "npm run deploy"
